2011.05411,dataset,04/24/22,4,"Another approach to preserve data privacy and security in ML is to utilise homomorphic encryption techniques, particularly in centralised systems, e.g., cloud servers, wherein data is collected and trained at a server without disclosing the original information. Homomorphic encryption enables the ability to perform computation on an encrypted form of data without the need for the secret key to decrypt the ciphertext [44]. Results of the computation are in encrypted form and can only be decrypted by the requester of the computation. In addition, homomorphic encryption ensures that the decrypted output is the same as the one computed on the original unencrypted dataset."
2011.05411,dataset,04/25/22,5,"As aforementioned, a trained ML model contains unintended features that can be utilised to extract personal information. Thus, local ML model parameters from a federated optimisation algorithm can be exploited by an adversary to infer personal information, particularly when combining with related information such as model data structure and meta-data. This information can be either original training data samples (i.e., reconstruction attack) [38, 111, 81, 4, 57, 96, 112, 6, 93, 130, 43] or membership tracing (i.e., to check if a given data point belongs to a training dataset) [15, 112, 86]."
2011.05411,dataset,04/26/22,6,"Data anonymisation or de-identiﬁcation is a technique to hide (e.g., hashing) or remove sensitive attributes, such as personally identiﬁable information (PII), so that a data subject cannot be identiﬁed within the modiﬁed dataset (i.e., the anonymous dataset) [92]. As a consequence, data anonymisation has to balance well between privacy-guarantee and utility because hiding or removing information may reduce the utility of the dataset. Furthermore, when combined with auxiliary information from other anonymous datasets, a data subject might be re-identiﬁed, subjected to a privacy attack called linkage attack [40]. To prevent from linkage attack, numerous techniques have been proposed such as k-anonymity [116], l-diversity [79], a k-anonymity-based method, and tcloseness - a technique built on both k-anonymity and l-diversity that preserves the distribution of sensitive attributes in a dataset so that it reduces the risk of re-identifying a data subject in a same quasi-identiﬁer group [73]."
2011.05411,dataset,04/27/22,7,"FL is well-suited for sorts of ML models that are formulated as minimisation of some objective functions (loss functions) on a training dataset for parameter estimation, particularly for gradient-based optimisation algorithms [70]. The minimisation objective can be formulated as follows:"

Training data in FL is unbalanced and non-IID, which is scattered across millions of personal mobile devices with signiﬁcant higher-latency, lower-throughput connections compared to the traditional techniques working on a cloud-centric data server. In addition, the data and computing resources in personal devices are only intermittently available for training. Therefore, to actualise FL, optimisation algorithms must be well adapted and eﬃciently performed for federated settings (i.e., federated optimisation [70])."
2011.05411,dataset,04/29/22,9,"Furthermore, the local nodes can leverage the perturbation method to prevent a coordination server and other adversaries from disclosing model parameters updates and original training dataset. The idea of employing perturbation technique to FL is that a local node adds random noise to its local model parameters in order to obscure certain sensitive attributes of the model before sharing. As a result, adversaries, in case it can successfully derive such model parameters, is unable to accurately reconstruct the original training data or infer some related information. In other words, the perturbation method could prevent adversaries from carrying out inference attacks on a local model trained by a particular client. This privacy-preservation method typically adopts diﬀerential privacy technique that adds random noises to either training dataset or model parameters, oﬀering statistical privacy guarantees for individual data [35, 33, 7]. Indeed, before the proposal of FL, diﬀerential privacy with SMC has been suggested as a privacy-preserving technique"
2011.05411,dataset,04/30/22,10,"Generally, there are three gradient descent methods that are categorised based on the amount of training data used in the gradient calculation of the objective function 𝑓 (𝜃) [103]. The ﬁrst category is batch gradient descent, in which the gradients are computed over the entire training dataset  for one update. The second category is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), that, in contrast to batch gradient descent, randomly selects a sample (or a subset) from  and performs the parameters update based on the gradient of this sample only (one sample per step, the whole process sweeps through the entire dataset). The third one is mini-batch gradient descent in which the dataset is subdivided into mini-batches of 𝑛 training samples (𝑛 is the batch-size); the parameters update is then performed on every mini-batch (single minibatch per step)."
2011.05411,dataset,05/01/22,11,"Geyer et al. in [48] have developed another method to implement diﬀerential privacy for federated optimisation in FL settings that conceals the participation of a user in a training task; as a result, the whole local training dataset of the user is protected against diﬀerential attacks. This approach is diﬀerent from the batch-level one, which aims at protecting a single data point in a training task. The proposed method utilises a similar concept of privacy accounting from [1] that allows a coordination server to monitor the accumulated privacy budget by observing the moment accountant and privacy loss proposed in [1]. The training process is halted once the accumulated privacy budget reaches a pre-deﬁned threshold, implying that the privacy guarantee is no further tolerated. The Gaussian mechanism is also used to generate random noise which is then added to distort the sum of gradients updates to protect the whole training data. The proposed method has been experimented on MNIST dataset, and the results show that with a suﬃciently large number of participants (e.g., about 10,000 clients), the accuracy of the FL trained model almost achieves as high as the nondiﬀerential-privacy baseline while a certain level of privacy guarantee over the local training data still holds."

Secondly, the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving techniques for centralised FL are described with the analysis of how these solutions can mitigate data security and privacy risks (Section 4).

2011.05411,dataset,05/03/22,13,"In this regard, FL is an alternative for the cloud-centric ML technique that facilitates an ML model to be trained collaboratively while retaining original personal data on their devices, thus potentially mitigates data privacy-related vulnerabilities. It is a cross-disciplinary technique covering multiple computer science aspects including ML, distributed computing, data privacy and security that enables end-users’ devices (i.e., local nodes) to locally train a shared ML model on local data. Only parameters in the training process are exchanged for the model aggregation and updates. The diﬀerence between FL and the standard distributed learning is that in distributed learning, local training datasets in compute nodes are assumed to be independent and identically distributed data (IID) whose their sizes are roughly the same. FL is, thus, as an advancement of distributed learning as it is designed to work with unbalanced and non-independent identically-distributed data (non-IID) whose sizes may span several orders of magnitude. Such heterogeneous datasets are resided at a massive number of scattering mobile devices under unstable connectivity and limited communication bandwidth [81, 80, 65]."

2011.05411,dataset,05/05/22,15,"It is worth to emphasise that the separation of the four steps in the cycle is not a strict requirement in every training round. For instance, an asynchronous SGD algorithm can be used in which results of the local training can be immediately applied to update the local model before obtaining updates from other participants [21]. This asynchronous approach is typically utilised in distributed training for deep learning models on a large-scale dataset as it maximises the rate of updates [29, 25]. However, in FL settings, the synchronous approach, which requires the coordination from a centralised server, has substantial advantages over the asynchronous ones in terms of both communication eﬃciency and security because it allows advanced technologies to be integrated such as aggregation compression, secure aggregation with SMC, and diﬀerential privacy [80, 71, 55, 120]."

In this respect, besides the legal basis such as consents from end-users, an FL service provider can only provide documentation of how FL-related mechanisms are implemented along with privacy-preserving technical measures such as secure aggregation, diﬀerential privacy, and homomorphic encryption. Other inquiries from DPAs such as direct access to the FL model training operations and inspection of individual local model parameters from a particular end-user are technically infeasible for any FL systems."

As a result, it is statistically indistinguishable between an original aggregate dataset and a diﬀerentially additive-noise one. Thus, a single individual cannot be identiﬁed as any (statistical) query results to the original dataset is practically the same regardless of the existence of the individual [34, 33, 35].

2011.05411,dataset,05/09/22,19,"Regarding the Fairness and Transparency requirements, as AI/ML algorithms like deep learning are normally operated in a black-box fashion, it is limited of transparency of how certain decisions are made, as well as limited understanding of the bias in data samples and training process [30, 83, 3, 91]. An FL system is not an exception. Generally, if the training data is poorly collected or intentionally prejudicial and fed to an ML, including FL, system, the results apparently turn out to be biased. If the trained model is then utilised for an automated decision-making system, then it probably leads to discrimination and injustice. Furthermore, the nature of preventing service providers from accessing original training dataset as well as the inability to inspect individuals’ locally trained ML model due to Secure Aggregation mechanism ampliﬁes the lack of transparency and fairness in FL systems. As a result, an FL system ﬁnds it problematic to transparently execute the training operations as well as to ensure any automated decisions from the system are impartially performed. This, consequently, induces the impracticality for any FL systems and fails to fully comply with the GDPR requirements of fairness and transparency."

However, with a large number of participants sharing a large fraction of gradients, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm with diﬀerential privacy is better than the standalone baseline.

FL allows local nodes to collaboratively train a shared ML model while retaining both training dataset and computation at internal sites [70].

Model parallelism requires mini-batch data is replicated at computing nodes in a cluster, as well as regular communication and synchronisation among such nodes [29]. Data parallelism, instead, keeps the completeness of the model on each computing node but partitions the training dataset into smaller equal size shards (also known as sharding), which are then distributed to computing nodes in each cluster [8]. The computing nodes then train the model on their subset as a mini-batch, which is especially eﬀective for SGD variants because most operations over mini-batches are independent in these algorithms. Data parallelism can be found in numerous modern ML frameworks including TensorFlow3 and Pytorch4.
